The user and any research assistants, co-workers or other workers who may use the Software

LICENSEE acknowledges that the Licensed Software is proprietary to EMBL. LICENSEE's 
obligation for confidentiality shall not extend to any information which is, or becomes, 
generally available to the public, is already known to, or subsequently disclosed by third 
parties to, LICENSEE and is at its free disposal, or is independently developed by LICENSEE 
or its affiliates without the use of the confidential information disclosed by EMBL, or is

the Licensed Software and to enter into this agreement and (ii) EMBLEM undertakes to use 
best efforts to cooperate with and assist LICENSEE, at LICENSEE's expense, in defending 
itself against any action based on the alleged infringement of any third party patent, copyright 
or trade secret rights resulting from or relating to the use or licensing of the Licensed 
Software by LICENSEE.

9. Indemnity and Disclaimer of Warranties

Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, EMBLEM makes no representations or 
warranties, expressed or implied. 
The Licensed Software is provided free of charge, and, therefore, on an "as is" basis, without 
warranty of any kind, explicitly or implicitly, including without limitation the warranties that 
it is free of defects, virus free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for 
a particular purpose or non-interfering. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of 
the Licensed Software including modifications of the Software is borne by LICENSEE.

By way of example, but not limitation, EMBLEM makes no representations or warranties of 
merchantability or fitness for the Licensed Software and any particular application or that the 
use of the Licensed Software will not infringe any patents, copyrights or trademarks or other 
rights of third parties. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the product is borne 
by LICENSEE. EMBLEM shall not be liable for any liability or damages with respect to any 
claim by LICENSEE or any third party on account of, or arising from the license or use of the 
Software.

Should the Licensed Software prove defective in any respect, LICENSEE and not EMBL 
or its affiliates should assume the entire cost of any service and repair. This disclaimer of 
warranty constitutes an essential part of this agreement. No use of the Licensed Software is 
authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

In no event will EMBL or its affiliates be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or 
consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the product, including, 
without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure 
or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if advised of the 
possibility thereof, and regardless of the legal or equitable theory (contract, tort or otherwise) 
upon which the claim is based. 

LICENSEE will be liable for all damages without limitation, which are caused by abuse of the 
Licensed Software service on EMBL’s server.

LICENSEE has no right to claim any indemnification based on LICENSEE's use of Licensed 
Software.

10. Promotional Advertising & References

LICENSEE may not use the name "XXX" in its promotional advertising, product literature, 
and other similar promotional materials to be disseminated to the public or any portion 
thereof. LICENSEE agrees not to identify EMBL in any promotional advertising or other 
promotional materials to be disseminated to the public, or any portion thereof without 
EMBLEM's prior written consent. For the avoidance of doubt, scientific literature is not 
defined as advertising and promotional materials.
LICENSEE agrees to cite the use of the Licensed Software on all related scientific 
publications, posters, grant applications, institutional reports or brochures. EMBLEM 
or EMBL shall not use LICENSEE's name in publicity or advertising involving this 

Agreement or otherwise without LICENSEE's prior written consent which may be withheld at 
LICENSEE's sole discretion. 

11. Term

This Agreement and the license rights granted herein shall become effective as of the date this 
Agreement is executed by both parties and shall be perpetual unless terminated in accordance 
with this Section.

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time effective upon the other party's breach 
of any agreement, covenant, or representation made in this Agreement, such breach remaining 
uncorrected sixty (60) days after written notice thereof.

Each party shall have the right, at any time, to terminate this Agreement without cause by 
written notice to the other party specifying the date of termination.

12. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Germany. Place of 
Jurisdiction shall be Mannheim.

13. General

The parties agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive agreement among the 
parties and supersedes all proposals and prior agreements whether written or oral, and all 
other communications among the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This 
Agreement cannot be modified except in writing and signed by both parties. Failure by either 
party at any time to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement shall not constitute a 
waiver by such party of such provision nor in any way affect the validity of this Agreement.
The invalidity of singular provisions does not affect the validity of the entire understanding. 
The parties are obligated, however, to replace the invalid provisions by a regulation, which 
comes closest to the economic intent of the invalid provision. The same shall apply mutatis 
mutandis in case of a gap.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the LICENSEE hereto has caused this Agreement to be duly 
executed on the date of access to the Licensed Software service and by accepting the license 
conditions by pressing the Acceptance button. 

I have read this License Agreement and I agree to uphold the terms and conditions of this 
license.
